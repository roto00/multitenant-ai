- ✅ Can use ARM64 Graviton instances
- ✅ Kubernetes ecosystem benefits

### Cons:
- ❌ More complex setup and management
- ❌ Spot instances can be interrupted
- ❌ Requires Kubernetes knowledge
- ❌ Additional EKS cluster costs

### Best For:
- Teams with Kubernetes expertise
- Complex microservices architectures
- High availability requirements

---

## Alternative 4: App Runner
**Estimated Monthly Cost: $100-150** 💰 **25-30% cost savings**

### Components:
- AWS App Runner service
- RDS PostgreSQL (db.t3.micro)
- ElastiCache Redis (cache.t3.micro)

### Pros:
- ✅ Simpler than ECS
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ Built-in load balancing
- ✅ Good for containerized apps
- ✅ No infrastructure management

### Cons:
- ❌ Less control than ECS
- ❌ Limited customization options
- ❌ Newer service (less mature)
- ❌ Limited monitoring options

## Cost Breakdown Comparison

| Component | ECS Fargate | EC2 Auto Scaling | Lambda | EKS Spot | App Runner |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Compute | $60-80 | $30-50 | $10-30 | $40-60 | $50-70 |

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Cost Optimization (Immediate)
1. **Remove NAT Gateways** - Use public subnets with security groups
2. **Switch to ARM64 Graviton** instances (t4g instead of t3)
3. **Optimize RDS and Redis** instance sizes

### Phase 2: Architecture Optimization (Medium term)
1. **Implement auto-scaling** policies
2. **Add monitoring and alerting**
3. **Optimize database connections**

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Long term)
1. **Consider Spot instances** for non-critical workloads
2. **Implement multi-region** deployment
3. **Add CDN** for static assets

## Implementation Steps

### For EC2 Approach (Recommended):
```bash
# 1. Update Terraform configuration
cp terraform/alternative-ec2.tf terraform/
cp terraform/user_data.sh terraform/

# 2. Update variables
# Set rds_instance_class = "db.t4g.micro"
# Set redis_node_type = "cache.t4g.micro"

# 3. Deploy
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### For Lambda Approach:
```bash
# 1. Update Terraform configuration
cp terraform/alternative-lambda.tf terraform/

# 2. Create Lambda deployment package
cd backend
zip -r ../api.zip .

# 3. Deploy
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

Regardless of the approach chosen, implement:

1. **CloudWatch Dashboards** for key metrics
2. **Cost alerts** to monitor spending
3. **Performance monitoring** for response times
4. **Error tracking** for failed requests
5. **Auto-scaling alerts** for capacity changes

---

## Conclusion

For your multi-tenant AI platform, I recommend starting with the **EC2 Auto Scaling approach** because:

1. **40-50% cost savings** compared to current ECS setup
2. **Better performance consistency** for AI workloads
3. **Full control** over the infrastructure
4. **ARM64 Graviton** instances provide better price/performance
5. **Easier migration** from current setup

The Lambda approach is excellent for **proof-of-concept** or **low-traffic** scenarios, while EKS is better for **complex, enterprise-grade** deployments.

Would you like me to implement any of these alternatives or provide more detailed migration steps?
